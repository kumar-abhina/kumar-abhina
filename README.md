## üöÄ SUMMARY

Hi, I'm Abhinav Kumar‚Äîa robotics engineer with a Master's in Robotics from Northeastern University, currently working as a Research Assistant. My research primarily focuses on robotic manipulation and grasping using deep learning and computer vision. I‚Äôve developed and trained reinforcement learning agents, often combined with imitation learning, to handle complex interaction tasks in cluttered environments.

In addition, I have strong hands-on experience with 3D perception, working extensively with tools like ROS/ROS2, PyTorch, and various SLAM toolboxes. While I‚Äôve explored SLAM systems, my core interest lies in applying AI to enhance robotic perception and intelligent control. I‚Äôm passionate about building real-world solutions that bridge learning and physical systems..
